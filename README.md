SeismographAPI
==============

ðŸ—º A Javascript API library built upon [SVG World Map JS](https://github.com/raphaellepuschitz/SVG-World-Map) and [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) for time series data visualization. 

> ***Attention:*** This project is under development and currently in early alpha phase. Detailed installation and integration with more examples will follow soon. 

This API provides a quick integration for the projection of time series data sets on world maps. Use this API library for **Choropleth Maps** for **Data Visualization** of scientific and statistical data, or as **Interactive Map** for your article, paper, website or app. 

The underlying [SVG World Map JS](https://github.com/raphaellepuschitz/SVG-World-Map) is just a small library for fast and simple data projection. If you need more advanced features for data visualization and SVGs, have a look at [d3js](https://github.com/d3/d3).  


Abstract
--------

Effective decision-making for crisis mitigation increasingly relies on visualisation of large amounts of data. While interactive dashboards are more informative than static visualisations, their development is far more time-demanding and requires a range of technical and financial capabilities. There are few open-source libraries available, which is blocking contributions from low-resource environments and impeding rapid crisis responses. To address these limitations, we present **SeismographAPI**, an open-source library for visualising temporal-spatial crisis data on the country- and sub-country-level in two use cases â€” [Conflict Prediction Map](https://conflict-ai.org/conflict-map/) and [COVID-19 Monitoring Map](https://conflict-ai.org/covid-map/). The library will provide easy-to-use data connectors, broad functionality, clear documentation and run time-efficiency.

Installation
------------

> ***Attention:*** As this project is currently under development, the installation may change in future versions. 


Add the `/src/` and `/lib/` folders to your project, include [seismographAPI.js](./src/seismographAPI.js) in your HTML document, then call the library:

```html
<script src="src/seismographAPI.js"></script>
<script>seismographAPI()</script>
```

This will load the SVG map and Chart.js via Javascript injection and initialize the library.   
So far for the basic setup.
